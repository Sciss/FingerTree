h2. FingerTree

h3. statement

This provides a data structure called FingerTree[1] for the Scala programming language. The code was basically extracted from the FingerTree class from "Scalaz":http://code.google.com/p/scalaz/, stripping away as much of the encumbered Scalaz as possible, so that it becomes a halfway self contained project. It is also an attempt to make a more standard Scala like interface, including ordered sequences and interval trees.

h3. notes

Currently the FingerTree, used for indexed sequences, is around 20 times slower than Scala's standard Vector class. Main problem I guess is missing specialization...

h3. building

This builds with Scala 2.9.1 and xsbt (sbt 0.11).

h3. todo

* Daniel Spiewak has an alternative implementation at "github":https://github.com/djspiewak/extreme-cleverness that should be benchmarked against this implementation

h2. FingerTree

h3. statement

This is an attempt to extract the FingerTree class from "Scalaz":http://code.google.com/p/scalaz/, while stripping away as much of its encumbered Haskell operating system and implicits orgy as possible. It is also an attempt to make a more standard Scala like interface, including ordered sequences and interval trees.

h3. notes

Currently the FingerTree, used for indexed sequences, is around 20 times slower than Scala's standard Vector class. Main problem I guess is missing specialization, but with Scala 2.8.1 it is impossible to add, as scalac chokes on almost any specialization annotation that you try to add :-(

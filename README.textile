h2. FingerTree

h3. statement

This is an attempt to extract the FingerTree class from "Scalaz":http://code.google.com/p/scalaz/, while stripping away as much of its encumbered Haskell operating system and implicits orgy as possible. It is also an attempt to make a more standard Scala like interface, including ordered sequences and interval trees.
